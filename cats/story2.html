      <p>My family needs me to be smart, confident, and reliable.</p>
      <p>My mother is a first-generation immigrant. She works at a call center.</p>
      <p>When she found out I had been diagnosed with clinical depression, she was angry.</p>
      <p>I think it was because she had spent her whole life working so that I could have a better life than she did</p>
      <p>just to find out that really, I had been struggling the whole time.</p>
      <p>I tried not to mention that I was depressed after that.</p>
      <p>My sister has a lot of needs.</p>
      <p>She has trouble finishing assignments, talking, eating in public, eating new things, doing new things, taking the bus, controlling her anger, and forgiving others.</p>
      <p>My parents used to tell me about how when I was born, the doctors were shocked because I didn't cry.</p>
      <p>My sister was the opposite. She was a colicky baby, so they spent a lot of time keeping her calm.</p>
      <p>I love my sister. She cries louder than me.</p>
      <p>I am smart, confident, and reliable.</p>
