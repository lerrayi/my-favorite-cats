        <p>When people assure me that I am normal, it makes me angry.</p>
        <p>If everyone feels like me, then why would they make the world so difficult to navigate?</p>
        <p>It feels impossible just to muster the strength to smile during conversations.</p>
        <p>How could I possibly make myself look acceptable to you?</p>
        <p>Still, I try to smile more, and I talk to myself in the car, and make faces in the mirror.</p>
        <p>Why does it feel so unnatural to do things this way?</p>
        <p>I wish I could code myself to respond to actions, the same way a robot can.</p>
        <p>Metal would be much better than this body</p>
        <p>that keeps sabotaging itself.</p>
