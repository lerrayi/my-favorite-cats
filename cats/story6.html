        <p>I always wished that people could make faces like the ones in cartoons or anime.</p>
        <p>Then, when a person is angry, they could contort their face</p>
        <p>or if they were embarrassed, they would blush, their eyebrows upturned.</p>
        <p>I can't tell what I am making people feel.</p>
        <p>Are they angry at me? Or too shy to speak? Are they simply focused?</p>
        <p>People who smile all the time frighten me.</p>
        <p>I was taught in school that people smile when they're happy. So why do smiling faces keep confusing me?</p>
        <p>How can I know that you're angry if you don't shout, or sad if you're not hushed?</p>
        <p>How can I know if you want me to go away?</p>
