        <p>Sometimes I think the world is really a wonderful place.</p>
        <p>Today, I learned that daisies are composite flowersâ€”arrangements of dozens of ray flowers, that look like petals,</p>
        <p>and disk flowers, which fill the center.</p>
        <p>I love plants very much. I look at the daisy on my windowsill every day and look for new facts.</p>
        <p>I even set it as my wallpaper. The soft pink of the ray flowers makes me calm.</p>
        <p>Through all of class,  I can't stop thinking about my plants and flowers.</p>
        <p>I look up care guides on my phone and before-after photos. I read botanical wikis. I look at Lowe's products.</p>
        <p>Just like that, class is done, and I'm happy to be free to think about my plants without constant interruption.</p>
        <p>I think of them as I go to sleep.</p>
        <p>Happiness like this is hard to find elsewhere.</p>
