        <p>I'm at a bar. It's not like how they look in the movies.</p>
        <p>In movies, the volume is controlled. The background is out of focus.
          You hear a few people talking. All that you need to see is seen.</p>
        <p>But this is not a movie. It's a nightmare. Talking, laughing, shouting all around me—</p>
        <p>music blaring, chairs moving, glasses clinking, coming closer, attacking me from all sides.</p>
        <p>I can't think. I try to look for people I know.</p>
        <p>Their mouths are moving. I can't focus on what they're saying, only the moving of their lips,</p>
        <p>and people, dozens—hundreds?—of people, everywhere, staring at me.</p>
        <p>They know there's something wrong with me. I want to know what they know.</p>
        <p>My eyes start to water.</p>
        <p>It's no different from how I felt when I was a kid.</p>
        <button class="next-btn">How did you feel when you were a kid?</button>

        <p>I'm 11 years old.</p>
        <p>I'm at a house party for my church, standing with my best friends in the whole world.</p>
        <p>They're talking to some people I don't know very well. It's loud.</p>
        <p>I try to speak with them, too. Everyone is talking over me.</p>
        <p>I don't understand. These are my best friends,</p>
        <p>but, they're brushing off what I say like I don't exist.</p>
        <p>The noise is too much.</p>
        <p>I know the basement is safe, so I try to leave. I open the basement door.</p>
        <p>The pastor tells me to come back.</p>
        <p>I open my mouth to say to him, politely, that I will go downstairs.</p>
        <p>What comes out instead is screaming.</p>
        <button class="next-btn">What does that have to do with anything?</button>

        <p>I went to the bar for my friend's birthday party.</p>
        <p>I think I'm not cut out for these things, but I wanted to make her happy.</p>
        <p>They take pictures together. I'm not invited.</p>
        <p>Everyone is walking around. They don't notice that they lost me.</p>
        <p>I tell them I have work tomorrow.</p>
        <p>They say they wish they had gotten more time with me.</p>
        <p>Why can't you just tell me the truth?</p>
        <button class="next-btn">They did.</button>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="parallax" id="s1-p4" style="display:none;">

        <p>You're right. They did tell me the truth.</p>
        <p>I'm 4 years old.</p>
        <p>I'm walking around the neighborhood with my best friends in the whole world.</p>
        <p>One of them is struggling to say something to me. I lift my head up to look at her.</p>
        <p>She says I can't hang out with them anymore.</p>
        <p>It's not fun with me there.</p>
        <p>It's one of the few times in my life where I'm scared of the quiet, not the noise.</p>
