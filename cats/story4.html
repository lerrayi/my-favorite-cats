        <p>I thrive on the predictable.</p>
        <p>Today, we're supposed to see my favorite band.</p>
        <p>I've listened to their whole discography, even the soundtracks they did for movies. I watched all their concerts from the past and tried to guess what they would play today.</p>
        <p>We have to take the metro. I've never done it before, but I think things will be okay.</p>
        <p>I don't understand the routes. I'm reassured we are going the right way. I'm scared.</p>
        <p>Watching the scene pass through the window, I start to relax. It's new, but pretty.</p>
        <p>We have to change seats. The train starts and I almost trip. A man urges me to sit next to him.</p>
        <p>I don't know what's going to happen. Everything shuts down. My eyes don't know what I'm seeing, and they're welling up with tears.</p>
        <p>I spend the rest of the day crying on what was supposed to be one of the happiest days of the year.</p>
        <p>I always hated that I was so rigid.</p>
